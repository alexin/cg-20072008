# cg-20072008
Semester assignment for the Computer Graphics class of 2007/2008.

The application showcases the fundamentals I have learned about computer graphics.

While rudimentary and buggy, it's possible to use solids to build a simple scene, set the camera's parameters and render an image of the scene using a basic ray tracing algorithm. There is also an OpenGL window to preview the scene in real-time.

#Disclaimer
Despite being a public repository, I do not intend to make this README more comprehensive for the time being. If you are reading this, then I suppose you are able to figure out most of this stuff on your own. If not, then feel free to contact me.
